This project contains Scala.js facades for the [Probot] framework used to build GitHub Apps on Node.js.

## ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

_This project is in active development, there are no published releases yet. Things may break without a warning, so don't rely on it._

If you want to experiment with it and write a GitHub bot in Scala.js, don't hesitate to write to the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/laughedelic/scalajs-probot) and ask any questions. And if you're looking for ideas, check out the dedicated [probot/ideas](https://github.com/probot/ideas) repo.

## Usage

First of all you should head to the [Probot docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/) and read at least the Getting Started part. It explains the basics very well and gives you a general understanding of how this framework functions.

For interacting with the GitHub API this library depends on the Scala.js facades for the Octokit library: [scalajs-octokit](https://github.com/laughedelic/scalajs-octokit).

For the usage example refer to the [scalafmt-probot](https://github.com/laughedelic/scalafmt-probot) project. The project setup will be simplified in the future.

### Installation

<details><summary>ðŸ›  Check installation instructions later, when there is a published release...</summary>

1. Add Probot dependency to your project. It's important that the version of the underlying JS library matches the one this facade is built for.

    * If it's a Node.js project where you manage dependencies with npm, run
        ```shell
        npm install probot@next --save
        ```

    * If it's a Scala.js project use [scalajs-bundler] and add to your `build.sbt`:
        ```scala
        Compile/npmDependencies += "probot" -> "7.0.0-typescript.4"
        ```

    These facades are based on the [TypeScript version of Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot/pull/372) which is not released yet, but is available under the `next` version tag.

2. Add facades dependency to your `build.sbt`:
    ```scala
    resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo
    libraryDependencies += "laughedelic" %%% "scalajs-probot" % "<version>"
    ```
    (see the latest release version on the badge above)

### Example

Here's a translation of the [Hello World example](https://probot.github.io/docs/hello-world/) from the Probot docs to Scala:

```scala
import scala.scalajs.js, js.annotation._
import scala.scalajs.concurrent.JSExecutionContext.Implicits.queue
import laughedelic.probot._

object HelloWorld {

  @JSExportTopLevel("probot")
  def probot(robot: Robot): Unit = {

    robot.on("issues.opened") { context =>
      // Post a comment on every new issue
      context.github.issues.createComment(
        owner  = context.issue().owner,
        repo   = context.issue().repo,
        number = context.issue().number,
        body   = "Hello World! ðŸ‘‹"
      )
    }
  }
}
```

The translation from JavaScript is pretty straightforward. A couple of things to notice:

* In JS all GitHub API parameters are just objects, so it's possible to reuse `context.issue` and write
    ```javascript
    context.github.issues.createComment(
      // context.issue appends given object to { owner: ..., repo: ..., number: ... }
      context.issue({body: 'Hello World!'})
    )
    ```
    In Scala `createComment` method has typed arguments, so we have to pass those values from the context explicitly. I don't think it's too verbose, but if anybody has an idea how to improve it, let me know.
* `{ context => ... }` callback returns a `Future` which is converted to a `js.Promise`, this is why the execution context import is needed.

For a more complex example and the general project setup refer to the [scalafmt-probot](https://github.com/laughedelic/scalafmt-probot) project.
