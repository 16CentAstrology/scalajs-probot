This project contains Scala.js facades for the Probot framework used to build GitHub Apps on Node.js.

## ðŸš§ WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸš§

_This project is in active development, there are no published releases yet. Things may break without a warning, so don't rely on it._

## Usage

### Installation

<details><summary>ðŸ›  Check installation instructions later, when there is a published release...</summary>

1. Add Probot dependency to your project. It's important that the version of the underlying JS library matches the one this facade is built for.

    * If it's a Node.js project where you manage dependencies with npm, run
        ```shell
        npm install probot@next --save
        ```

    * If it's a Scala.js project use [scalajs-bundler] and add to your `build.sbt`:
        ```scala
        Compile/npmDependencies += "@octokit/rest" -> "7.0.0-typescript.4"
        ```

    These facades are based on the [TypeScript version of Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot/pull/372) which is not released yet.

2. Add facades dependency to your `build.sbt`:
    ```scala
    resolvers += Resolver.jcenterRepo
    libraryDependencies += "laughedelic" %%% "scalajs-probot" % "<version>"
    ```
    (see the latest release version on the badge above)
